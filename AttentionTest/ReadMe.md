## Mackworth Clock Test
* Test written in Psytoolkit, based on the example code to test attention of participant.
* Corrected the code as the example was erroneous (for eg.: marked as jump even if no jump or vice versa), and improved the bitmaps used.
* Added trial and test blocks based on user feedback and protocol design, as test is difficult to do otherwise.
* Added **timing information** from the beginning of the code, so as to synchronize (within few 100ms) with the NCS data.
