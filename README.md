Code for applications of Near-Field Coherent Sensing (NCS) using RFID tags in vital sign detection.

Near-field coherent sensing (NCS) enhances the RF energy coupling into the body and thus boosts the backscattering signal from heartbeat, 
breath, and motion on and inside the body. Mechanical movements that result in dynamic dielectric boundary changes are modulated onto 
the radio signals with unique digital identification (ID), which can be readily extended to monitor multiple tags and persons by a 
single RFID reader with good channel isolation.
